A really basic Smart Contract written in solidity that can be deployed to the Rinkeby testnet 
or the Ethereum Mainnet.

The Inbox.sol file can also be used in Remix IDE to deploy and interact with the contract.

Changes that need to be made in the deploy.js file
1.Setup Metanmask and enter Seed Phrase (Rinkeby for Testing)
3.Create Infura Ethereum API(Rinkeby for Testing)
  It should look like this https://rinkeby.infura.io/...
